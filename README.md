This is a simple tutor management system which enables teachers or management to keep track of the school/college or boards or classes or students within it.
The below functionalities has been provided:

2. Edit the existing board
3. Click on the board ID to add additional classes or batches to the existing classes
4. Add students
5. Add multiple students at once to a specific batch
6. View complete student information(attendance, grades, batches)
7. Monitor assessments by the teachers
8. Add assessments or add a student for a particular assessment
9. Also, a summary page describing the school or college (like total boards in the school, total students, batches, classes) 

Note: This site has been built using php, bootstrap 3, html 5, jquery, javascript, etc. Not to mention this site has been built by me in just 2 days without getting any sleep starting from the overall system design to working out databases to making the UI look simple and elegant.
Feel free to use it or go through the code or extend it. 

Cheers!
